Strip 1 is placed in magnetic field B_{1} and strip 2 is placed in magnetic field B_{2}, both along positive y-directions. Then V_{1} and V_{2} are the potential differences developed between K and M in strips 1 and 2, respectively. Assuming that the current I is the same for both the strips, the correct options is/are :",
